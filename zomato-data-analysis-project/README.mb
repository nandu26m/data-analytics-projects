# Zomato Data Cleaning & Transformation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and transforming a real-world dataset from Zomato. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis or modeling by performing the following steps:

1. Deleting redundant columns  
2. Renaming columns for clarity  
3. Dropping duplicate rows  
4. Cleaning individual columns (trimming spaces, handling missing values, fixing inconsistent entries)  
5. Handling missing values (`NaN`) effectively  
6. Applying additional data transformations (creating new features, encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric columns)  

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from [Kaggle: Zomato Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/zomato).
